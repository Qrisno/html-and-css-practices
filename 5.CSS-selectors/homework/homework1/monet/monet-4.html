            <h1> HE WAS SO FRUSTRATED WITH LIFE THAT HE JUMPED INTO THE SEINE.</h1>
            <p>In his late 20s, Monet was frustrated with the Académie, France’s art establishment. He hated creating formulaic artwork, copying the art that hung in the Louvre, and painting scenes from ancient Greek and Roman myths. Although he tried to
                get his paintings into the Académie’s art exhibits, his art was almost always rejected. Depressed and struggling to support himself and his family financially, Monet jumped off a bridge in 1868. He survived his fall into the Seine and
                began spending time with other artists who also felt frustrated by the Académie’s restrictions.</p>
